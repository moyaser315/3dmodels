# This is a repo for implementing 3d models in a simplified way 
## papers that is planned to be implemented :
- [x] PointNet
- [ ] PointNet++
- [ ] DGCNN
- [ ] Point-MAE
- [ ] Shape As Points

PointNet and PointNet++ structre was inspired by [yanx27 repo](https://github.com/yanx27/Pointnet_Pointnet2_pytorch/tree/master)


#TODO:
- [ ] Make backend
- [ ] Make a simple viewer
- [ ] use [fpsample](https://pypi.org/project/fpsample/#:~:text=Python%20efficient%20farthest%20point%20sampling,in%20single%2Dthreaded%20CPU%20environment.) for deployment
